# hello-world
brief greeting 

##Hello readers!

I am a *new* coder writing my first repository. I enjoy puzzles, riddles, and trivia. I apologize for any **noobish** mistakes :smile:.

I enjoy exploring therories on artificial intelligence and seeing the way *technology* and *virtual reality* shape our future. 
Westworld series on HBO has started to touch on interesting theories regarding artificial intelligence and perceived realities. 
Ask me about my theories, I'm happy to share them.
